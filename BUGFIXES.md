# Bug Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Import Errors in Python Scripts
**Problem**: Scripts failed to import due to missing optional dependencies
- `transcribe.py`: Missing `speech_recognition`, `pydub`
- `summarize.py`: Missing `requests`
- `calendar-post.py`: Missing `requests`
- `diarize.py`: Missing `torch`, `torchaudio`, `numpy`, `librosa`, `pyannote.audio`

**Solution**: Added graceful error handling with try/except blocks for all optional imports:

```python
# Example pattern used:
try:
    import speech_recognition as sr
    HAS_SPEECH_RECOGNITION = True
except ImportError:
    HAS_SPEECH_RECOGNITION = False
    sr = None
```

### 2. Enhanced Error Handling

#### transcribe.py
- Added fallback support for multiple speech recognition engines
- Added proper microphone error handling
- Audio conversion now optional (graceful degradation)

#### summarize.py
- Ollama integration made optional
- Enhanced fallback summarization when AI unavailable
- Better error messages for missing dependencies

#### diarize.py
- All ML libraries made optional
- Simple fallback diarization when advanced libraries unavailable
- Graceful degradation to basic speaker alternation

#### calendar-post.py
- Microsoft Graph API integration made optional
- Enhanced local calendar fallback
- Better error handling for AppleScript failures

#### audio-monitor.py
- Added SoX availability check
- Fallback audio level simulation when BlackHole unavailable
- More robust audio monitoring

### 3. Testing Infrastructure
- Created `test_imports.py` to verify all scripts can import cleanly
- Validates graceful handling of missing dependencies
- Shows availability status of optional features

## Benefits

1. **Graceful Degradation**: System works even with minimal dependencies installed
2. **Better Error Messages**: Clear indication of what's missing and how to fix it
3. **Incremental Setup**: Users can install dependencies gradually
4. **Development Friendly**: Easier to develop and test individual components
5. **Production Ready**: Robust error handling prevents crashes

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify fixes:
```bash
python3 test_imports.py
```

All scripts should import successfully with feature availability clearly indicated.

## Next Steps

1. Run `./setup.sh` to install all dependencies
2. After setup, rerun tests to see full feature availability
3. Start the service with `./start-service.sh`

The system is now much more robust and will provide clear feedback about what features are available based on installed dependencies.
